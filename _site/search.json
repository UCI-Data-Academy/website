In particular, they become familiar with methods associated\nwith data collection, data processing, data summarization and\nvisualization, and statistical modeling approaches for prediction.\nMoreover, statistical inference techniques for testing scientific\nhypotheses are discussed. Lastly, students learn about statistical\nthinking for decision making under uncertainty. Students will apply the\nconcepts communicated through the lectures by analyzing real data, using\nthe statistical programming language R. Lecture notes will be provided.\nThrough teamwork and interactive learning, students will become involved\nwith the processes related to scientific investigation and inquiry, with\napplications in biology and medical sciences, among others. By the end\nof the program, students will work on a capstone project based on a\nreal-life scientific problem and will present their findings to a\nbroader audience. Through the Donald Bren School of Information and\nComputer Sciences, DATA students will: Engage in hands-on analytics\nprojects, involving real life scientific data; Learn how to formulate\nscientific questions and utilize statistical thought process to provide\npractical solutions to those problems; Interact and engage with\nuniversity faculty and college students and visit research labs in the\nSchool’s three departments; Explore career pathways in data science and\nrelated fields; Work in teams while emphasizing the essential skills\nrequired for scientific research, including creativity, communication,\ncollaboration, and critical thinking; Projects will emphasize Science,\nTechnology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) concepts and be\ncorrelated with Common Core Standards and the Framework for Next\nGeneration Science Standards.\n\n\n\n",
