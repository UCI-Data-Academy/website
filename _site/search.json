The students will learn about\ndata science methods and concepts via hands on projects. In particular,\nthey become familiar with methods associated with data collection, data\nprocessing, data summarization and visualization, and statistical\nmodeling approaches for prediction. Moreover, statistical inference\ntechniques for testing scientific hypotheses are discussed. Lastly,\nstudents learn about statistical thinking for decision making under\nuncertainty. Students will apply the concepts communicated through the\nlectures by analyzing real data, using the statistical programming\nlanguage R. Lecture notes will be provided. Through teamwork and\ninteractive learning, students will become involved with the processes\nrelated to scientific investigation and inquiry, with applications in\nbiology and medical sciences, among others. By the end of the program,\nstudents will work on a capstone project based on a real-life scientific\nproblem and will present their findings to a broader audience. Through\nthe Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, DATA\nstudents will: Engage in hands-on analytics projects, involving real\nlife scientific data; Learn how to formulate scientific questions and\nutilize statistical thought process to provide practical solutions to\nthose problems; Interact and engage with university faculty and college\nstudents and visit research labs in the School’s three departments;\nExplore career pathways in data science and related fields; Work in\nteams while emphasizing the essential skills required for scientific\nresearch, including creativity, communication, collaboration, and\ncritical thinking; Projects will emphasize Science, Technology,\nEngineering and Mathematics (STEM) concepts and be correlated with\nCommon Core Standards and the Framework for Next Generation Science\nStandards.\n\n\n\n",
